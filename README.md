# Sort Buddy: A Visual Sorting Companion

## Visualize Sorting Algorithms in Real Time

**Sort Buddy** is a powerful tool that helps you understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. It provides a clear and interactive representation of bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and quick sort using bar graphs.

## Key Features:
- **Visualize Sorting Algorithms:** Watch as your data is sorted in real time, making it easier to grasp the concepts behind each algorithm.
- **Interactive Controls:** Experiment with different data sets and sorting algorithms to see how they perform in various scenarios.
- **Learn Through Code:** Access a built-in blog that explains the theory and code behind each sorting algorithm, making it a valuable learning resource.

## Getting Started:

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/priyanshuk7/Sort-Buddy.git
```
## Usage:
- **Input Data:** Enter the data you want to sort.
- **Choose Algorithm:** Select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, or quick sort).
- **Watch the Visualization:** The program will display an interactive bar graph, demonstrating the sorting process step by step.
- **Learn the Theory:** Access the blog section to read detailed explanations and code examples for each algorithm.
